/** The public API for this gesture recognition library. The implementation
  * details (including documentation of the algorithm) are "hidden" in the
  * [[protractor.minutiae]] package.
  *
  * The fundamental units that the recognition algorithm works with are
  * [[protractor.Stroke]] instances, which can be the movement of the mouse
  * starting at a `mousePressed` and ending with a `mouseReleased`, or the
  * movement of a finger while it is in contact with a touch-sensitive device.
  *
  * A sequence of one or more consecutive [[protractor.Stroke]] instances, with
  * [[protractor.Pause]] intervals between them, is wrapped in a
  * [[protractor.Gesture]] instance, which provides the methods to compare it
  * to other [[protractor.Gesture]] instances.
  *
  * [[protractor.MouseEventBuffer]] can be used to collect incoming
  * [[java.awt.event.MouseEvent]] data and convert it to a
  * [[protractor.Gesture]].
  *
  * @define uniform The points are expected to be sampled at a uniform rate (so
  * the time elapsed between each pair of consecutive points is a constant).
