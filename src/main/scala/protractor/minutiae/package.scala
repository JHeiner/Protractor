// historical note: I moved the following into their own files when I started
// using ScalaIDE because it seemed to have occasional difficulty finding the
// source code for something (e.g. with F3, or clicking on stack traces).
// ScalaIDE is getting smarter, and the following aren't relevant in debugging
// anyway, so I moved them back here. I liked having the original organization
// (4 files, no deep folders) because this project is so small. I wish I could
// go back to that, but for now there's this uneasy balance between the way
// Java/Eclipse wants things to be and the way Scala/SBT lets things be.
