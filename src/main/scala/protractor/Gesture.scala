/** Holds the information about a gesture - possibly one just captured from
  * the user's manipulation of a hardware device (mouse, touchscreen, etc.),
  * or maybe one that has been stored in the application with an action to
  * take when the user makes that gesture. The primary purpose of this
  * library is to provide a way to measure how similar two `Gesture`s are to
  * each other - the [[protractor.Gesture.similarity]] method does that.
  *
  * Note that this constructor is not really part of the public API - most
  * applications will use [[protractor.MouseEventBuffer.gesture]] or the
  * [[protractor.Gesture]] function in the [[protractor]] package object.
  *
  * @param strokes the "massaged" stroke data
  * @param limit the maximum angle this gesture is allowed to be rotated
  * before calculating the distances between stroke points.
